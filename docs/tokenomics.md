PSY is purely a governance token that manages the smart contracts, and treasury of tokens through on-chain voting. Proposals will be made on-chain, and voted on with the PSY token. 

The PsyOptions protocol does generate fees from minting and exercising, volume on permissioned Serum markets, and affiliate fees from the user interface integrated with Serum order books. These fees are deposited into an address controlled by the governance protocol, with which PSY tokens can make proposals and cast votes.

The PSY Token breakdown is as follows:
<ul>
    <li>Team/Contributors/Advisors: 15%</li>
    <li>Private Round 1: 5%</li>
    <li>Private Round 2: 7%</li>
    <li>IEO: 3%</li>
    <li>DAO  Treasury: 60%</li>
    <li>External contributor fund: 8%</li>
    <li>PSY liquidity provisions: 2%</li>
</ul>

Yes, Team and Private Round coins are vested for four years with a one year cliff. However, during the Token Generation Event, 0.5% of the Private Round 1 and 0.7% of the Private Round 2 coins will enter the circulating supply.

#### Where Can I Get PSY?
PSY is currently available on the following exchanges, with more to come:
